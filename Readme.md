This is a repository for posting my Figma learning journey.

## The approach:
1. Identify a page, component or screen on the web. Sources could be google images, figma community, behance or dribble.
2. I will attempt to recreate the design identified in Figma
3. I will export the design to SVG and PNG
4. The projects will be organized in folders with YYYY-MM-DD naming convention
5. Inside each folder will be a readme.md file about that particular day's project and learnings

## Timeline
First day is 2022-11-07. Hopefully, I can generate enough enthusiasm to do a project a day, for 1 year. But I will take it a day at a time.

## Objective
The aim is to build a expert-level proficiency in Figma. I will then attempt enrolling in the toptal network and build an upwork profile seeking UI design work.

To infinity and beyond!%%
