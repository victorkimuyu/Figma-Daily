The challenge for this day was to create a Files navigation pane for the [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app.
I inserted the icons using [iconify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/Iconify) figma plugin.

I am using this app to do my notes and organize my work.

The icons I used in my design are not identical to the ones used for the challenge but I did not want to get hung up on the details too much.

Overall, I am fairly satisfied with how this one turned out.
