### Day 2
Todays challenge is to design a section of the [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) navigation, specifically the flyout that pops up when you hover over a menu item.

It is good though not pixel perfect. The icons are not precisely the same as the ones used on the dribbble menu but are close enough. As always, I turned to the trusty [iconify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/Iconify) plugin to search and insert icons.
